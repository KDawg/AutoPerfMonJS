<h3>PerfMon R&D</h3>

<p>This demo is based on a the technique <em>Aspect Oriented Programming</em> discussed by
  Rodrigo Fernandez. I saw his talk <a
    href="http://www.slideshare.net/RodrigoFernandez33/monitoring-for-the-masses">Monitoring
    for the Masses</a> at HTML5DevConf</p>

<p>You'll see this demo uses AOP for automatically, and I'll claim invisibly,
  measuring code execution time.
  The browser's recently added <em>User Timings</em> API is leveraged because it is a
  highly precise timer producing results as fine as a fraction of a millisecond.</p>

<h3>Running</h3>

<p>Open the <code>index.html</code> and use the <em>Chrome Developer Tools</em> and look
  at the <em>Console</em>
  seeing program results. Read the JavaScript code confirming why the run-time output is
  interesting.
</p>

<p><code>main.js</code> has the main entry point of the source code. It has a series of
  local functions
  clearly documenting the process of setting up AOP, executing some slow code, reporting
  on the timing measurements, and breaking down the applied AOP. It uses two distinct
  styles of code.</p>

<p><a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> is used to bring in the meld library
  because it's built with that dependency module format. To keep consistency the project's
  rother sample code sits in files with modular definition.</p>

<p><code>server.js</code> has the first style of code. It's a legit JavaScript Class. One
  of its functions is math intensive. That's what main applies AOP to for invisibly
  measuring execution time.</p>

<p><code>compute.js</code> has a JavaScript object with some data and functional
  attributes. One
  of them is math intensive and that's what main applies AOP to. During the run you'll
  see it measure execution and report on it.</p>

<p>Measurement stats are recorded by the main app. It attaches its own functions that are
  run before and after the time consuming function implemented by the two modules
  it requires in.</p>

<h3>Additional Reading</h3>

<p>Read <a
  href="http://know.cujojs.com/tutorials/aop/intro-to-aspect-oriented-programming">about
  AOP</a> and learn why it's a useful technique.</p>

<p>Leverages a library called <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/meld">meld</a> that
  implements AOP for J/S.</p>

<p>Some of this work takes advantage of the browser's
  <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webperformance/usertiming/">User
    Timing</a> API for high-resolution timers. APIs include:</p>
<code>performance.mark(), .measure(), .getEntriesByType()</code>

<p>Apparently the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.5/reference/aop.html">Java
  community established AOP</a> pattern.</p>
